# How it works

code(human) ➡️ compile(compiler) ➡️ executed

## What's compilation?

Compiler converts the code into a different format(binary) that computer's CPU can execute.
We need compilers to bridge human - computer worlds by translating human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.

## What's syntax?

The syntax of programming language

- keywords
- perators(semicolon, parenthesis)
- grammar rules... etc.

Syntax highlighting is a helpful feature to spot mistakes in the code.

## How did your code work?

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

- `WriteLine()` is a method.
- `Console` is a class. Classes "own" methods. All of the methods that operate on the Output pane are defined inside of the Console class.
- `.` (the period) is the member access operator. It's used to access members of a class.
- `;` (the semicolon) is the statement terminator. It tells the compiler that the statement is complete.

## Understand the flow of execution

The code instructions are executed in order, one line at a time. Some of the instructions require the CPU to watie before it can continue.
